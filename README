Based on: http://oddthesis.org/theses/jboss-rails

Supports exposing session beans as QMF objects (using @QMFObject),
declaring QMF-serializable classes using @QMFType, @QMFEvent and @QMFSeeAlso,
and injecting agent using @QMFAgent.

Only single agent is currently supported, in order to configure it (broker url for example) 
one must add a qmf-agent.properties file to the classpath. A sample one is provided in the source
tree.

To install...
- Build the latest qpid java code
- run mvn install
- Copy the jboss-qmf-0.01-deployer.jar into your server's deployers/ directory.
