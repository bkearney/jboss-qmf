Based on: http://oddthesis.org/theses/jboss-rails

Supports exposing session beans as QMF objects (using @QMFObject),
declaring QMF-serializable classes using @QMFType, @QMFEvent and @QMFSeeAlso,
and injecting agent using @QMFAgent.

Only single agent is currently supported, in order to configure it (broker url for example) one must manually edit
qmf-deployer-jboss-beans.xml file.
